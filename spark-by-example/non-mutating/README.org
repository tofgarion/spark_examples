* Non-mutating algorithms

  This directory contains the specification and implementation files
  for the following algorithms: ~Find~, ~Find_First_Of~,
  ~Adjacent_Find~, ~Equal~, ~Search~, ~Search_N~, ~Find_End~ and
  ~Count~. As usual, ghost functions used in specification are located
  in the ~spec~ directory at project root.
