** The Adjacent_Difference algorithm

The ~Adjacent_Difference~ algorithm will compute for each index ~J~ of an array,
the difference between the value at index ~J~ and the value at index ~J-1~. Its signature reads:

#+BEGIN_SRC ada
procedure Adjacent_Difference (A : T_Arr; B : in out T_Arr)
#+END_SRC

*** Specification of Adjacent_Difference

To be able to properly specify this algorithm we will need to write an overflow verification function 
for substractions. One could argue that using the function ~Add_No_Overflow~ defined along function [[Accumulate.org][Accumulate]]
with a minus sign in front of the second argument: ~Add_No_Overflow(X,-Y)~, but if our function 
must work with the entire range of ~T~, which is the entire range of Ada ~Integer~, then there is one case in which 
executing ~-Y~ triggers and overflow, since there is one more negative Integer than positive integers.

We then write a new function ~Minus_No_Overflow~:

#+BEGIN_SRC ada
function Minus_No_Overflow
    (X,Y : T) return Boolean 
    is
    (Y = 0
    or else (Y < 0 and then T'Last + Y >= X)
    or else (Y > 0 and then T'First + Y <= X));
#+END_SRC

The working principle of this function is the same than the one of ~Add_No_Overflow~.

We can now give a specification for ~Adjacent_Difference~:

#+BEGIN_SRC ada
 procedure Adjacent_Difference
     (A : T_Arr; B : in out T_Arr)
     with 
     Pre => (if A'Length > 0 then 
     (for all J in A'First+1 .. A'Last => Minus_No_Overflow(A(J),A(J-1))))
     and then B'Length = A'Length,
     Post => (if A'Length > 0 then B(B'First) = A(A'First) 
     and then (for all J in A'First+1 .. A'Last => B(B'First+J-A'First) = A(J)-A(J-1)));
#+END_SRC

The precondition state that there should be no overflow when substracting any value to the one following,
and that both arrays should be of same length.

The postcondition ensures that The first elements of both arrays are equal, and that each element of ~B~
is the result of the substraction of the corresponding element and the previous one in ~A~.

*** Implementation of Adjacent_Difference

with this specification we can write an implementation for the procedure:

#+BEGIN_SRC ada
procedure Adjacent_Difference
     (A : T_Arr; B : in out T_Arr)
   is
   begin
       if A'Length > 0 then
	 B(B'First) := A(A'First);
	 
         if A'Length = 1 then
            return;
         end if;
         for J in A'First+1 .. A'Last loop
	    
	    pragma Assert(Minus_No_Overflow(A(J),A(J-1)));
            
            B(J-A'First+B'First) := A(J) - A(J- 1);
	    
	    pragma Loop_Invariant(for all K in A'First+1 .. J =>
				    B(B'First+K-A'First) = A(+K)-A(K-1));
	    pragma Loop_Invariant(B(B'First) = A(A'First));
	    	    
	 end loop;
	 
      end if;
   end Adjacent_Difference;
#+END_SRC

The algorithm is really simple, the only annotations are the assertion, which checks that our computation
won't generate any overflow, and the loop invariants verify that we are doing the correct calculation, and that the first index 
of ~B~ is constant.

With this specification and implementation, ~gnatprove~ proves everything.
