   Cannot use Contract Cases with array slice. Bug reported and
   corrected in SPARK development version
   (cf. https://gt3-prod-2.adacore.com/#/tickets/P630-039).

*** TODO investigate function proof for case when B is not a subsequence of A

    SPARK cannot prove this part of the postcondition (cf. line 171 of
    chap3.ads). Counterexample given : Result = 0 and Size_A = 1
    (A'First = 1, A'Last = 1).
