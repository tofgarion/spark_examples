** The Insertion_Sort algorithm

The ~Insertion_Sort~ algorithm sorts an array in ascending order. Its signature reads

#+BEGIN_SRC ada
procedure Insertion_Sort(A : in out T_Arr)
#+END_SRC

The ~Insertion_Sort~ algorithm sorts an array by locating the appropriate index in the sorted array
for the current value being examined at each iteration. ~Insertion_Sort~ and [[Selection_Sort.org][Selection_Sort]] work in 
a similar way, the main difference being that ~Insertion_Sort~ performs less comparisons between elements,
but has to write more values, whereas ~Selection_Sort~ performs more comparisons, and less writes to the memory.

*** Specification of Insertion_Sort

The specification of ~Insertion_Sort~ is identical to the one of ~Selection_Sort~ (In fact, it should be 
the case for all sorting algorithms):

#+BEGIN_SRC ada
procedure Insertion_Sort(A : in out T_Arr) with
     Pre => A'Last < Positive'Last,
     Post => Sorted(A) 
     and then Multiset_Unchanged(A,A'old);
#+END_SRC

*** Implementation of Insertion_Sort

~Insertion_Sort~ could be implemented with the help of the [[../mutating/Rotate.org][Rotate]] algorithm, as it was done in [[https://github.com/fraunhoferfokus/acsl-by-example/blob/master/StandardAlgorithms/classic-sorting/insertion_sort/insertion_sort.c][ACSL by example]]:

#+BEGIN_SRC ada
procedure Insertion_Sort(A : in out T_Arr)
   is
      K : Integer;
   begin
      if A'Length = 0 then
	 return;
      end if;
      
      for J in A'Range loop
	 K :=(if J = A'First then A'First else Search_Upper_Bound(A(A'First .. J-1),A(J)).Value);
	 if K < J then
            Rotate(A(K .. J),J-K);
         end if;
      end loop;     
      
   end Insertion_Sort;
#+END_SRC

This approach, while being concise makes the proof quite difficult since the specification of 
~Rotate~ only specifies equality of ranges, and we would need to deduce from these equalites that
the multiset represented by ~A~ has not changed, and that the order of the elements of ~A~ remained
relatively stable. To make our proof easier we will take another approach, where we emulate the effects
of ~Rotate~ with a loop of [[../mutating/Swap_Array.org][Swap_Array]], which we can annotate to our needs:

#+BEGIN_SRC ada
procedure Insertion_Sort(A : in out T_Arr)
   is
      K : Integer;
   begin
      if A'Length = 0 then
	 return;
      end if;
      
      for J in A'Range loop
	 K :=(if J = A'First then A'First else Search_Upper_Bound(A(A'First .. J-1),A(J)).Value);

	 for L in reverse K .. J-1 loop
	       
	    Swap_Array(A,L,L+1);
	    
	    pragma Loop_Invariant(if L > K then A(L-1)<=A(L+1));
	    pragma Loop_Invariant(Multiset_Unchanged(A,A'Loop_Entry));
	    pragma Loop_Invariant(for all M in A'First .. L-1 => A(M) = A'Loop_Entry(M));
	    pragma Loop_Invariant(Sorted(A(A'First .. L-1)));
	    pragma Loop_Invariant(for all M in A'First .. K-1 => A(M) <= A(L));
	    pragma Loop_Invariant(for all M in K .. J => A(M) >= A(L));
	    pragma Loop_Invariant(Sorted(A(L .. J)));
	 end loop;
	 
	 pragma Loop_Invariant(Sorted(A(A'First .. J)));
	 pragma Loop_Invariant(Multiset_Unchanged(A,A'Loop_Entry));
	 
      end loop;     
      
   end Insertion_Sort;
#+END_SRC

In this implementation we can see that there is a second loop embedded within the main loop. Its function
is to insert the element found found at index ~J~ at index ~K~ by shifting all the elements between
these indexes by one place to the right.

One thing to kepp in mind when analysing the secondary loop is that the value at index ~L~ is constant and equal
to ~A'Loop_entry(J)~.

The invariants in the secondary loop verify that (in order of appearance):
- ~A(L-1) <= A(L+1)~, this is used to prove the sorted aspect of the indexes ~K~ through ~J~ at the end of the loop
- we only apply permutations on ~A~
- We only modify the indexes higher than ~L~, this helps prove that the begining of the array is sorted.
- With the previous invariant, we prove that A is sorted from indexes ~A'First~ through ~L-1~
- We verify that the values at indexes les that ~K-1~ are greater than ~A(L)~. This will be used to prove that the array is sorted on indexes ~A'First~ through ~J~.
- The two last invariants enable to prove that the array is sorted from indexes ~L~ through ~J~.

When combining the loop invariants on sorting, and the fifth loop invariant at the exit of the secondary loop
we can proove the first loop invariant of the main loop. The ~Multiset_Unchanged~ of the main loop is proved 
with the corresponding invariant of the secondary loop.


With this specification and implementation ~gnatprove~ proves everything.
